**Plan
- This will be a solo project.
- The purpose is to find works of art quickly by searching for specific artists or their art by name. You can also find art by the material of the art, the technique it was mad with, or the relative date it was created.  The audience for this is anyone looking for specific works of art or artists quickly, like students or art enthusiasts.

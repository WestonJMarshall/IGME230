### Name: Art Express

## Plan
- This will be a solo project.
- The purpose is to find works of art quickly by searching for specific artists or their art by name. You can also find art by the material of the art, the technique it was made with, or the relative date it was created.  The audience for this is anyone looking for specific works of art or artists quickly, like students or art enthusiasts. 

## Details
- Currently the prototype of the web app has full search capabilities to search through the database based on title, artist, technique, type, and material. You can also limit the number of entries shown.
- All of the code runs without errors, it should be able to prevent missing files from causing issues.
- All of the interactable elements are easy to identify and use.
- All code and CSS are external.
